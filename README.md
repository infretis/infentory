Infentory is an inventory of tutorials and example files for the infretis software.

# Summary
* 🟣 [puckering](puckering) is an in-depth and somewhat timely tutorial using GROMACS, given as an exercise in a molecular modeling course
* 🔵 [infinit_nh3_inversion](infinit_nh3_inversion) - a system illustrating the use of the <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02c38f6b-613b-409b-a779-7d3898664d3f" alt="drawing" width="80"/> functionality
* 🟢 [water_dissociation](water_dissociation/lammps) is a very basic tutorial with LAMMPS
* 🟡 [2d_potential](2d_potential) is a simple 2D toy sytem with the ASE engine, reproducing a [pyretis example](https://www.pyretis.org/current/examples/examples-2d-hysteresis.html)
* 🟠 [chignlin](chignolin) contains some information on infretis input and output files, and how to interpret the output of the **WHAM** analysis

Some of the example systems are not directly runnable out of the box, as initial paths are not provided, but they can be generated with `infinit`.
