Unveiling Molecular Secrets with Path Sampling in AMS
</h1>
We have branched this tutorial out to keep the commit history of infentory light!

Through [this tutorial](https://github.com/wilkek/infentory/blob/ams_examples/ams/TUTORIAL.md), we aim to demonstrate the capabilities of path sampling. It allows us to study rare events that can be hard or impossible to investigate using conventional molecular dynamics methods. The algorithms and software utilized in this assignment are the result of very recent active developments. 
The instructions on the linked branch shall guide your way from an initial structure towards running a RETIS simulation and what tools are there to make the most out of your simulation data. Contributions, questions and suggestions are always welcome!

The prerequisites to follow the tutorial are a recent version of AMS2025 or newer, including PLAMS.
